In case anyone felt like giving me anything, I list my wishes here:

Miscellaneous
-------------

* [Music Box Kit](http://www.kikkerland.com/products/make-your-own-music-box-kit/) (USD 22). Getting more than one is even fine, because then we may perform orchestral pieces like [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9wWRxYSko).

<!--
Computer
--------

<!--
* [A Microsoft Kinect](http://www.google.com/products/catalog?q=buy+kinect&hl=en&prmd=ivsun&resnum=1&biw=1280&bih=703&um=1&ie=UTF-8&cid=6853633111128295882&ei=ud8ITYeRK8aXOrzZlbEE&sa=X&oi=product_catalog_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CEsQ8wIwAA#) that is only the Kinect, no Xbox please (DKK 1199).

Books
-----

* "[Confidence](http://www.amazon.com/Confidence-Overcoming-Self-Esteem-Insecurity-Self-Doubt/dp/1594631263)" by Tomas Chamorro-Premuzic.
* "[Food & Cooking](http://www.amazon.com/McGee-Food-Cooking-Encyclopedia-Kitchen/dp/B00BW8LFLM/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1382565397&sr=1-1&keywords=Food+%26+Cooking+-+An+encyclopedia+of+kitchen+science%2C+history+and+culture) - An encyclopedia of kitchen science, history and culture" by Harold McGee.
* "[Sangbogen I](http://www.saxo.com/dk/sangbogen-1-spiralryg_spiralryg_9788759808801)" (number one) a collection of lyrics and musical notes.

Or something nice. I'm sure that you can figure it out :)
