In case anyone felt like giving me anything, I list my wishes here (closing in on Christmas it is updated weekly):

Miscellaneous
-------------

- [Music Box Kit](http://www.kikkerland.com/products/make-your-own-music-box-kit/) (USD 22). Getting more than one is even fine, because then we may perform orchestral pieces like [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9wWRxYSko).
- Headphones that work in traffic (not completely isolating). Must fit under a beanie or a bicycle-helmet.

<!--
Computer
--------

<!--
* [A Microsoft Kinect](http://www.google.com/products/catalog?q=buy+kinect&hl=en&prmd=ivsun&resnum=1&biw=1280&bih=703&um=1&ie=UTF-8&cid=6853633111128295882&ei=ud8ITYeRK8aXOrzZlbEE&sa=X&oi=product_catalog_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CEsQ8wIwAA#) that is only the Kinect, no Xbox please (DKK 1199).
