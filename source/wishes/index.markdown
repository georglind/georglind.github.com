In case anyone felt like giving me anything, I list my wishes here:

Miscellaneous
-------------

* [Mood Mugs](http://store.yankodesign.com/all-products/mood-mugs) (Cheeky Chappy n' Happy as Larry) - by Yanko Design
* [Music Box Kit](http://www.kikkerland.com/products/make-your-own-music-box-kit/) (USD 22). Getting more than one is even fine, because then we may perform orchestral pieces like [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9wWRxYSko).

Computer
--------

* [A Microsoft Kinect](http://www.google.com/products/catalog?q=buy+kinect&hl=en&prmd=ivsun&resnum=1&biw=1280&bih=703&um=1&ie=UTF-8&cid=6853633111128295882&ei=ud8ITYeRK8aXOrzZlbEE&sa=X&oi=product_catalog_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CEsQ8wIwAA#) that is only the Kinect, no Xbox please (DKK 1199).

Books
-----

* "Food & Cooking - An encyclopedia of kitchen science, history and culture" by Harold McGee
* "Course of Theoretical Physics" by Landau and Lifshitz, 10 volumes.

Or something nice. I'm sure that you can figure something out :)
