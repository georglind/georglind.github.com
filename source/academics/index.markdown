<!--
2003- During my senior year in high school I wrote a major report on the subject of Introductory Quantum Mechanics.
2005- In my freshman year studying Physics, I wrote another report on The decay-channels of the Z particle together with three of my fellow freshmen.
2005- Notes on Algebra for the course Alg2.
2007- Notes on The Philosophy of Science for the course VtMat.
