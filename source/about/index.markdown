My name is Kim Georg Lind Pedersen and I have just completed my M.Sc. in Physics at the Niels Bohr Institute at the University of Copenhagen. My master thesis roamed the fields of nonequilibrium Kondo transport and cold atom optical lattices.

I have been granted a full PhD scholarship by the Faculty of Science, University of Copenhagen during which I will focus on magnetic quantum transport.
