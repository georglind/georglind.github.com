My name is Kim Georg Lind Pedersen and I am a theoretical condensed matter physicist with a special interest in quantum transport. I have worked with both numerical and analytical methods mainly to calculate scattering amplitudes, simulate the evolution of ensembles and--in general--perform many-body calculations. 

I have taken worked in several different branches of condensed matter physics. My master project dealt with analytical calculations of the nonequilibirum Kondo problem. 

I completed my PhD at the Niels Bohr Institute, University of Copenhagen, researching 
molecular electronics and electronic correlations and molecular electronic pumps. Simultaneously I  published several papers on techniques for measuring spin correlations of cold atoms in optical lattices. 

I am currently employed as a Postdoctoral Researcher in a position split between theoretical condensed matter physics and quantum optics.
